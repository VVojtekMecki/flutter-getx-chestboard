# lab4_chess_fen

Flutter project with two flutter_chess_board widgets and a getx controller that. 
Two controllers with two tags as an instance of a single class are being created
and each has assigned board to it. 

Clicking "Update fen" button moves a user to the second tab where one can choose a new fen.
The new fen is assigned to the board which button was clicked. 
Choosing a fen gets back to the original main page
